                    <p>The 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket 88, is cited to be the first full-sized muscle car. It was the first time a V-8 engine
                was available in a smaller and lighter body style. The Rocket 88 was said to have "launched the modern era of the
                high-performance V-8."</p>

                        <p>The 1968 Ford Mustang GT may be the most iconic muscle car of all, thanks to its co-starring role in the Steve McQueen movie Bullitt. McQueen piloted a Highland Green Mustang to immortality in what many consider to be the greatest movie car chase of all.</p>
